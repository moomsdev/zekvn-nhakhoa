Email deliverability made SOLID. Connect to your chosen email provider with an intuitive set-it-and-forget-it SMTP plugin. Reliable, efficient, secure.

== Description ==
Your WordPress website is sending emails out daily, but are your users and visitors receiving them? When it comes to ensuring email deliverability, lean on a proven equation: SMTP plugin + email service provider = success. Solid Mail is an easy-to-use, set-it-and-forget-it SMTP plugin that will help you stop worrying about email deliverability.

= ‚ùìHow does Solid Mail Help You Implement SMTP Email on your website? =

Solid Mail makes connecting to many popular SMTP services straightforward and clear. Solid Mail currently supports the following Email Service Providers (ESPs):

* Sendgrid
* MailGun
* Brevo (formally Sendinblue)
* Amazon SES
* Postmark
* Manual connection (connect to any ESP)

Enjoy complete flexibility and reliability in email delivery. Set up multiple connections to send emails via different Email Service Providers according to the From: address, and choose a fallback connection to ensure messages are sent even if a connection fails or the address doesn‚Äôt match an existing connection.

= ü§îWhy Should You Use an SMTP Plugin for Your WordPress Website Instead of the Native PHP Mail? =

WordPress out the box uses PHP‚Äôs built-in mail function to send emails such as password reset requests, WooCommerce order invoices and more. The issue? PHP Mail is only as good as your server and most hosts don‚Äôt have dedicated PHP Mail monitoring.

Even hosts that specialize in hosting WordPress either don‚Äôt offer email services or don‚Äôt actively monitor for deliverability. That means you can be at the mercy of noisy neighbors sending spam to purchased email subscriber lists, or spammers running the latest scam. Either way it impacts the health of the server in the eyes of ESPs such as Google, Yahoo, Outlook, and others meaning that most of the time your emails don‚Äôt even hit the inbox!

Go from spam-box to inbox with Solid Mail: an SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) plugin. Combine with an email service provider such as SendGrid, Brevo, Amazon SES, and others and see your emails start getting delivered.

An SMTP plugin ‚Äì like Solid Mail ‚Äì is essentially a higher-level and more advanced method of sending emails between servers that uses a username and password or other secure method to create the connection to an email service provider (ESP). ESPs (like those listed below) provide robust solutions to deliverability issues by running dedicated servers for sending that are managed ‚Äòround the clock for issues like blacklisting, spam removal, and more. In addition they use authentication protocols like SSL/TLS to secure email transmissions and ensure better deliverability.

Using an SMTP plugin combined with an email service provider instead of PHP Mail on the server leads to more reliable, secure, and efficient email communication for WordPress websites.

= üìëHow does Solid Mail Validate Email Deliverability with Email Logs? =

Solid Mail gives you an easy-on-the-eyes interface to review and inspect your comprehensive email logs and understand if your email was sent or not. This transparency helps in debugging any email deliverability issues with your website.

Many email service providers offer advanced features like email tracking and analytics. Solid Mail‚Äôs email logs help optimize email strategies by making it easy for you to view and act on patterns and trends.

= üìß Email Logging is a great way to help troubleshoot WordPress email deliverability issues =

But how do you know and validate that your emails are actually being sent from your website correctly? The answer is email logs.

Email logs are crucial for validating that your emails are being delivered as intended, serving as an indispensable tool for troubleshooting and ensuring reliability in communication. These logs provide detailed records of every email transaction, including timestamps, recipient addresses, and errors in the SMTP authentication process.

To configure your WordPress website to send email using any SMTP email provider with Solid Mail, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to ‚ÄúSolid Mail > Connections
2. Select the appropriate email provider from the dropdown
3. Add the credentials for that email provider.

For more information, see the [documentation](https://go.solidwp.com/solid-mail-documentation).

= Can I create multiple connections using different SMTP services? =

Yes! You can create multiple connections, each using a different service, and send mail via those connections based on the From: address of the message being sent.

This is especially useful if you‚Äôd like to use different services to send mail for various operational needs i.e., configure a connection to handle transactional emails sent from your WooCommerce store address, another for WordPress account-related emails, etc.

= What happens if one of my connections has an issue? =

For peace of mind, you can set a Default connection as your site‚Äôs fallback.

If a connection fails or an email is sent from an address without a matching connection, it will be automatically sent through the Default connection for a second delivery attempt.
